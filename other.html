                    <h1>1.What is Web Pages?</h1>
                    <p>A web page is a single hypertext document available on World Wide Web (WWW). 
                        It is composed of HTML elements and displayed on the user's browser such as Mozilla, 
                        Firefox, Chrome, etc. It is also referred to as "Page."
                    </p>
                    <p>A webpage is a document written in HTML and can be viewed on any web browser. It is contained 
                        within the web server, which can be accessed by entering the URL for that web page, and once it is loaded, 
                        it appears on the user's web browser. Each webpage is linked with a unique URL; hence two pages cannot have the same URL.
                    </p>
                    <p>A simple webpage can be created very quickly.
                        It takes very little time to create a webpage compared to a Website.
                        A web page and a website should be compatible with any device, such as Mobile, Desktop, Laptop, etc.
                        The search engine provides a web page through a link, and when a user clicks on that link, it is redirected to the webpage of a website.
                        A webpage can have any type of information including videos, and audios.
                        It can be made up of only HTML(Hypertext Markup Language), or CSS, or JavaScript for dynamic and attractive behavior.
                    </p>
                    <p>A simple web page is created using HTML, which is a markup language. However, we can also use CSS and JavaScript to add more functionalities and make it more attractive.</p>
                    <p>It is created using HTML, hence containing different markup tags that specify how the data should be formatted on screen.

                        The webpage is contained within the webserver. To load this webpage, a client sends the request to the server, and generally, the browser is known as the client, which can request the page on the internet.
                        
                        The web browser requests the page on the internet. Once it is responded to by the server, the browser interprets the markup tags and displays them on the user's screen in the correct format.
